# Kaggle Santa 2018

## Data exploration

To visualize the Python notebook, create a virtual environment:
```
conda create -n santa python=3.6
```
Then install the requirements by running:
```
activate santa
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(On Mac some commands may slightly differ)

Then open the notebook using:
```
jupyter notebook "Santa 2018 - Data preparation.ipynb"
```
